# A customization script is intended to be used to customize a scene in
# various ways, mainly when simulation is not running. When simulation is running,
# do not use customization scripts, but rather child scripts if possible
#
# Make sure you read the section on "Accessing scene objects programmatically"
# For instance, if you wish to retrieve the handle of a scene object, use following instruction:
#
# handle=sim.getObject('./sceneObjectName') # will search in the current scene object hierarchy
#
# Refer to the user manual and the code snippets, for additional details and infos about
# available callback functions
