# A child script is intended to give an object/model a specific simulation
# functionality. It is only executed while simulation is running.
#
# Make sure you read the section on "Accessing scene objects programmatically"
# For instance, if you wish to retrieve the handle of a scene object, use following instruction:
#
# handle=sim.getObject('./sceneObjectName') # will search in the current scene object hierarchy
#
# Refer to the user manual and the code snippets, for additional details and infos about
# available callback functions
