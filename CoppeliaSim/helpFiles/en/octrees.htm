<h1>OC trees <img src="images/octrees1.jpg"></h1>


<p>An OC tree is an <a href="objects.htm">object</a> that represents a spacial partitioning. It is made up by a tree data structure in which each node has exactly eight children. Occupied leaf nodes are represented as voxels. OC trees can be used to offer a simplified representation for <a href="shapes.htm">shapes</a> or <a href="pointClouds.htm">point clouds</a>, or can act as an occupancy grid/space:<br>

<p>OC trees are <a href="collidableObjects.htm">collidable</a>, <a href="measurableObjects.htm">measurable</a> and <a href="detectableObjects.htm">detectable objects</a>. This means that OC trees:<br>
</p>

<li>can be used in <a href="collisionDetection.htm">collision detections</a> with other collidable objects.</li>
<li>can be used in <a href="distanceCalculation.htm">minimum distance calculations</a> with other measurable objects. </li>
<li>can be detected by <a href="proximitySensors.htm">proximity sensors</a>.
</li>

<p>OC trees can be added to the <a href="scenes.htm">scene</a> with [Menu bar --&gt; Add --&gt; OC tree], and edited via the <a href="octreePropertiesDialog.htm">OC tree properties</a>.<br>
</p>

<p>The OC tree calculations (i.e. collision, distance and proximity sensor calculations) available in CoppeliaSim are also available as stand-alone routines via the <a href="coppeliaGeometricRoutines.htm">Coppelia geometric routines</a>.</p>
