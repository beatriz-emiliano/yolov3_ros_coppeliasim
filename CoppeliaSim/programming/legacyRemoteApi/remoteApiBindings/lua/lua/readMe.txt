Make sure you have following files in your directory, in order to run the various examples:

1. the appropriate remote API library: "remoteApi.dll" (Windows), "remoteApi.dylib" (Mac) or "remoteApi.so" (Linux)
2. simpleTest.lua (or any other example program)

For more examples, have a look at the python folder: language is different but principles are the same
